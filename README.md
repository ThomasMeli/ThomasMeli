In 2016, when AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol in Go, my world was shaken.  I had been playing Go since I was 15, and never thought a computer would beat a professional human.

I now believe the most important breakthroughs that will happen in the next 20 years will probably occur due to improving our computational intelligence and resources.  I'm excited to use data science to partner with companies committed to solving our most pressing social and environmental problems.

Dengue Fever is a mosquito-borne disease that often occurs in the tropics.  There are nearly half a billion cases of Dengue in Latin America alone.

*Use vegetation indices and other weather variables to find strong correlations with mosquito incidence.
*Did a time series analysis to break down the time series into its unobserved components.
*Interpolated missing data with a linear approximation due to the continuous nature of the variables.
*Used sequence sensitive deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, etc.)
*Ensemble these techniques with tree based regression classifies (XGBoost, Extratrees).

Achieved the top 8% in the world out of all participants.
