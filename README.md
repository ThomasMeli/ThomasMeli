In 2016, when AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol in Go, my world was shaken.  I had been playing Go since I was 15, and never thought a computer would beat a professional human.

I now believe the most important breakthroughs that will happen in the next 20 years will probably occur due to improving our computational intelligence and resources.  I'm excited to use data science to partner with companies committed to solving our most pressing social and environmental problems.

## Featured Projects

### Dengue Fever Analysis

Dengue Fever is a mosquito-borne disease that often occurs in the tropics.  There are nearly half a billion cases of Dengue in Latin America alone.

* Use vegetation indices and other weather variables to find strong correlations with mosquito incidence.
* Did a time series analysis to break down the time series into its unobserved components.
* Interpolated missing data with a linear approximation due to the continuous nature of the variables.
* Used sequence sensitive deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, etc.)
* Ensemble these techniques with tree based regression classifies (XGBoost, Extratrees).

Achieved the top 8% in the world out of all participants.

### SARIMA Prediction

* Used a SARIMA model (Seasonal autoregressive model) to successfully predict ~30 time steps ahead.
* Created a visual guide that led to the notebook to be highly upvoted by the Kaggle community.

### Rare Species Classification

Ecological ID - Mel Spectrograms | Convolutional Neural Nets | Data Augmentation | GPU Learning | Tensorflow | Keras

Conserving rare species is both very important and represents a difficult data challenge  Because these species are rare, we have less information about them…

* Preprocessing audio for high signal to noise ratio samples.
* Dealing with class imabalance.
* Converting sound to spectrograms for visual analysis.
* Data augmentation for out of sample learning.
* Creatively using false positives to increase classifier accuracy.
* Used functional Keras API for multiple model inputs.


### Missingness Analysis

If missing data is not missing at random, then the fact that data is missing can itself be important information.  In this missing data analysis, I show ‘fancy’ data imputation methods perform sub-optimally compared to a simple mean imputer.  

* Missing data analysis.
* Imputation comparisons.
